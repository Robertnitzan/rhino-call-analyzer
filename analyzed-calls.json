And then we have another area that has a similar problem. You mentioned that it's like multiple houses or a few houses? No, it's one house, but multiple projects in the same house. Oh, I see. Okay. Alrighty. So basically, so you can you repeat the scope of work that needs to be done? We want to get the walls inside painted. I really want to redo our bathroom closet doors. And then outside we have a patio, and the wood needs a roof on top. Oh, got it. And how big is that structure that needs a roof on top? Do you know like the estimate? I don't, but if someone can come out and give us a quote, that would be best, because I don't know anything about it. All right. And what city are you located? Pleasant Hill. Pleasant Hill. Okay. Hold on a second. Let me check my calendar. One second. Oh, it's already February. Okay. I know how time flies. We do have an opening on Wednesday, the 4th, at 10 o'clock. Will that work for you?

      "transcript": "No builders. Please hold for the next available agent. This call is being recorded. Hello, this is Roli. Yes, hi. My name is Roy Roos, and I have a house in Santa Mona. The walkway part of the walkway has dropped about an inch and a half where it connects to the driveway, and I was hoping that I could get an estimate from you guys to lift that back up. Oh, sure thing. I just want to make sure, how many square meters, I mean square footage does that take, the walkway I mean? Well, the walkway, I don't know how to explain it. It's about two feet wide, maybe a little bit more than that, not much, and it's in sections with control joints at about 53 inches, and I think there's a couple of sections. As you pick it up, it goes back to the section behind it, right? But the one section that actually shows something is that 53 inches long by about two feet wide. I see. We're actually a general contractor, and we take big jobs. I don't think we can take this for now. I'm really sorry. Nothing small like that, huh? Yeah. Well, I have some other issues. There's a small portion of the driveway. That would be nice to level that out, and then there might be some foundation cracks that need to be filled. I see. Okay. I think we can check out the site, and let's see from there, from our project manager. When do you think is the best time for us to check the site? Well, I'm available mornings from around 1030 to around 1 o'clock. All right. Let me check our schedule. Hold on. Seems that we are free tomorrow at 11. Does that work? Actually, you know, that might be okay, tomorrow at 11. I'm getting a couple of different bids, and so I have another appointment that's a little bit earlier, so you'd be like after them about half an hour after they're done, I guess. Okay. All right. Can I take your address? Can I take your address? It's 9669 Thunderbird Drive. Thunderbird Drive. In San Ramon. San Ramon. Hold on. Let me double check. 9669. Right. Thunderbird Drive. All right. And what is your full name for us to put in there? Roy. Roy Roos. R-O-O-S. Got it. All right. And this is the best number for us to call back, right? Yes. All right. And that is 925-200-5109. And what time was that again? 11, did you say? Yes. Tomorrow at 11. 11. Okay. Yep. Hold on. Let me see. So, I have one question though before we do all of this. If I only decide to do that walkway area, that's going to be too small for you guys to do? That would be for our project manager to decide. Okay. Because there's a water line that goes under that would need to be protected, I guess. The water line, the main water line that feeds the house, I think that's what actually caused the problem. There was a leak some time ago. And it evacuated the soil underneath, I guess, some of it. And then slowly that little section of walkway keeps going down right over the top of the water line. And I'm afraid it's going to break the water line because it's a PVC water line. I see. Okay. I'll take a note on that. The water line underneath that needs to be protected. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, I would imagine it'd be nice to put maybe, I don't know, a piece of ABS pipe over the top of that water line when you when you inject the foam so the foam doesn't actually go all the way, you know what I mean, to keep the water line protected if that or something like that. I don't know. I'm just thinking about that as a thought. Okay. I took a note and then I'll let our project manager know. He can give you some advice when he's there. And then your email for us to send in the estimate. It's A-N-T-O-N-R-O-S-Z at A-T-T dot net. At A-T-T dot net. Okay. It's A-N-C-O-N-R-O-S-Z. No, not C. T-O-N. Anton Rose. A-N-T-O-N. A-N-T-O-N-R-O-S-Z at A-T-T dot net. That's it. All right. All right. I'll have someone over there by tomorrow at 11 a.m. All right. I'll be there. All right. Thank you, Roy. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.\n",

I have a kitchen hood that I need put in my kitchen, a very large kitchen hood, but my ceiling is sloped, and I need a little bit of a build-out in order for the kitchen hood to be put in a flat surface. Oh, so basically you just need to adjust the ceiling where the hood is going to be located so it'll fit? Yes. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, I think this kind of job is for a handyman because our jobs are actually major remodeling, like if you want to do additions, ADUs. This is something that unfortunately we do not service, this type of job. Okay. You think a handyman is going to be able to... Okay. It needs to be structurally ... Oh, I see. Yeah. Have you tried Sumtech? Do you think a handyman? Yeah. Not really a handyman. Somebody who's also licensed, but you can try Sumtech. You can choose different contractors from there that can do this type of job. All right. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. \n",

Okay, I'll have you on the list, and then we'll let you know once we have some projects for you. Okay, sounds good. I just wanted to give a call back, you know, reach out this year.

It should be under Juan. Yes, I see it. Juan Lopez, garage conversion and ADU. Yes, correct. Do you want me to reschedule or just have it canceled? I do need the estimate. The thing is I'm having the property appraised and the appraiser, this is what he decided to book it. So I will be in the area. You know, it's just that I don't know how big the window is for the person coming out. But the appraisal is supposed to happen between 10. He's appraising my primary residence and then also that duplex. So I just don't know, you know, if I'll be in the area on time. Yeah, so I think I'll call back. But I'll let you know that tomorrow by 12 and 2 to 3, we're open by that time. Just in case that you need. Oh, you have an opening at 12? Yes. Yes, we do. Okay. That might work better. You want me to reschedule right now just to confirm that it's on 12? The thing is, I don't know how, you know, this is my first time working with this appraiser. And I don't know how punctual he'll be. So if he's saying he'll be here at 10. Yeah, he'll be here at 10 in the morning in San Leandro to appraise my primary residence. And he's saying that takes about maximum an hour. So, which means that I would be, we would be heading over to the Hayward property around 11. Right. And then I could just stay there until noon. That would not be a problem. You know, but if this guy decides to not show up at 10 and show up later. It might get, yeah. Exactly. It might get complicated. Yeah. So I don't want to, you know, I don't want to waste your time. So I think what I'll do is I'll just call back and reschedule when I have a better idea.

      "transcript": "Builders. Please hold for the next available agent. Hello, good afternoon. Is this Rinova Builders? All right, Rinoa Builders. How can I help? Yes, we have a job that we would like to see if you're interested in. It's a kitchen and bath refresh and it's in Arenda. It's in Arenda, all right. Have you spoken to a designer already? Do you have plans available or is it? Well, it's not something that needs plans. It's reface the cabinets, put in a backsplash new counter, and probably some cabinet drawer work. And then in the bathroom, it's removing a tub and then essentially retiling. That's sort of what it is. Got it. And okay, yeah, we can definitely give you an estimate for that. So what we normally do is that we would like to do a site visit so we can, you know, like evaluate the existing conditions and we'll take it from there. So we do have an opening next week, say, Tuesday on the 27th. And it's going to be in the afternoon around, let's just say around 1 p.m. Will that work for you? That might be hard because I have to work in San Francisco. Oh, okay. So what's a good time for you? Either really early or really late. Okay. What's really late for you? You know, 5. 5 p.m.? 4.30, something like that. 5 p.m., yeah. Okay. Can we do like 4.30 instead? Sure. Okay. We can do 4.30 on Tuesday, the 27th. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. Just so you know, we've sort of settled on a color palette and other things. We just need to execute now. And it's something that I think needs a contractor's attention and we don't want to do it ourselves. Well, that's even better because all we have to do is just to put them all together. And you've already decided that. That's the harder part, actually, like choosing the finished material. Yeah, we spent like six weeks doing that. I know. Okay. So can I please get your first and last name? Don Kavanaugh. K-A-V-A-N-A-G-H. Oh, N-A-G-H. Okay. All right. Thank you. And what's the best number to reach you, Don? 415. 2775-0471. All right. And what's the property address? 221 Village Gate Road. Arenda? Yes. Sorry. Okay. All right. What's your email address? It's Don.Kavanaugh. And I'll spell it again. K-A-V-A, like Victor. K-A-V-A-N-A-G-H. At gmail.com. Perfect. All right. Perfect. So I'll set you up for Tuesday. That's going to be the 27th at 430 p.m. Okay? Yeah. That sounds good. I'll call you. I can't look at my calendar at the moment, but I'll call you back if there's any conflict. Yes. Yes, please do. And I'll send you a text confirmation for this appointment. Did you happen to do those on the weekends or just weekdays? Normally just weekdays. Okay. I'll work with that. Okay. All righty then. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. You too. Have a good one. Bye-bye. You too. Bye. All right. Bye.\n",

      "transcript": "Hello? This is Roley. Hey, Roley. Hey, this is Danny at BPX Printing. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Good. Okay, you sent this job over that you wanted us to quote you all for first. Now, it's only like two sheets. You want these in color or black and white? In color. Okay. So, and then it looks like the 8 and a half by 11s, it looks like that's like a job card that we print on, like double-sided on cardstock. That for sure is black and white for the job card. Yeah, yeah, that's all black and white, yeah. But the sheets has like stamps on them and stuff. And you're trying to get these delivered to Orenda or shipped or, I mean, Yeah, we want it shipped to 13 Carmen, Orenda. Yeah, when did you, how soon do you need these to get over there? As soon as you can get them delivered. Maybe now or tomorrow morning. Well, I'd have to, if I ship them out, they get to tomorrow probably by 1030. If we drive them over, I don't, I can't drive it over today. My drivers are all out tied up and I don't know what time tomorrow we will be able to get out to Orenda. So I can give you a quote for the printing and verbally tell you what we were charged to drive it over or how much it would cost to ship it overnight. If you want, I can work this pricing out and give you a call back in probably like 10 minutes or so. Okay, I'll just wait for the paper because I need that forwarded to my boss. I can't just say it in verbal. Okay, so you need me to email it to you? Yeah. Okay. So how do you want me to email you, with the shipping or with the delivery? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Because it would be more to deliver it. I mean, I'm sorry, it would be more to ship it. So I can just give you the shipping price, which would be a little bit more, and then you can give me a call and let me know if you want to ship. I can just tell you now, okay, so delivery would be like $27 for shipping it overnight. And if I drive it out there, it would be $15 plus $7.95 for the fuel charge. So you're looking at $27 or $24.75 or $24.95. So it's pretty much not much of a difference for driving and shipping it. It's just a matter of getting it there at a specific time. Okay, so can you say that again? It's either $27? $27 to ship it overnight, and it should be there by like, it's going over into maybe 10.30 a.m., 11 o'clock at the latest. And if we deliver it, I charge $15 to deliver to like outside of our area, which is over into, and then it would be a $7.95 fuel charge for driving it there. So you're looking at $15 plus $7.95, so $22.95 or $27. Got it, okay. I think it's just a few dollars difference, but we're not really that in a hurry. Maybe we'll just go with that. With us driving it over? Yeah. Okay, so I'll work you up a quote with us driving it over. And like I said, it could be 9.30 in the morning. It depends on how busy we are tomorrow morning.

I have a delivery that I was working on with Selden. He asked me to reach out to Vivian, but I think I just missed her. He told me she was leaving at 1 for the payment. So this is Roli. Oh, hi, Roli. How are you? Just clocking in. So, okay, for which job is this again? This is for 1099 Via Medea. I sent it over to office. If you want, I can forward it over to you. And then if you want to just confirm it, and then you can let me know. Roli. I don't see it on our office. Hold on, let me wait for one of my emails. Yeah, I'll send it to you as well, just in case. I was going to try Clayton next, but I haven't talked to him in a while either, so I didn't know if he was around. He's not working with us anymore. Oh, he hasn't? Okay, yeah. I figured I'd try the landline or the main office line first. It still will get forwarded to either me or Vivian. Okay, okay, perfect. Okay, I see it. Received. I'll send this to, I think, the project manager. I'll confirm this with them, and then I'll let you know when we're going to do the payment. Perfect, perfect. Yeah, so we have it set up for tomorrow afternoon. As soon as you can, let me know. We just have to take care of it either today or, like, really early in the morning. Oh, okay. I'll call you, and then I'll let you know. Sounds good. No problem. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. Thank you.\n",

I'm calling on behalf of Red Oak Realty. How are you? Red Oak Realty. How can I help? Yeah, yeah. It was just a quick call. I'm working with Red Oak at the moment as they are creating their first relocation and lifestyle magazine. The agents will be using it to introduce new buyers and sellers to the area. And it's really kind of going to be something to show off the community and the lifestyle. So I was just calling to see if you might be interested in getting some details about featuring Rhino Builders in there as, of course, it aligns well with the clientele of Red Oak. And I thought it'd be a really good fit for you guys. Where is Red Oak at? So Red Oak Realty, they have four offices within the area. So you've got Oakland, Berkeley, El Cerrito and San Leandro. Oh, I see. Would they be areas that you focus on? As of the moment, we do have our marketing campaign. We already have started that ongoing. But you can just send us an email and if we would want to do that in the future, so we'll reach out. Of course. Yeah. What's the best email for me to send some details to? I sent one before, but I'm not sure if it was the right one. It's office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Perfect. Yes. So I have sent an email across with some details already. It may have just gone into junk or spam. But just so you are aware, I'm in the area week commencing the 2nd of February where I'll be hosting meetings to go through the opportunity and how it might be beneficial for businesses. So if that's of interest, once you've reviewed the email, let me know and I'd love to come and see you guys to talk about it in detail. All right. Sounds good. Fabulous. No problem. Well, any questions in the meantime, just let me know and I'll be happy to help. I have to go. I have another call. Thank you. Okay. All right. No problem. Bye. Thank you. Bye-bye. All right.

      "transcript": "for the next available agent. ♪♪ Hello, good morning. Hello, is this Rhino Siding and Window Replacement? Yes, it is. Who's calling, please? Hi, this is Trey calling from Lickheap Properties. I'm inquiring for a siding installation, actually, for a new building that we're working on. Do you guys offer quotes for that? We do, but are you a contractor? We own the lot and we're working on it. Well, one of our team is basically the general contractor for it, yeah. Oh, okay, but you just need somebody to do the siding for you. That's correct, yeah. And can you tell me what's the extent of the siding that needs to be, is this a replacement or a new siding? New siding. Okay, and what's the square footage of that siding? Or maybe like how many, is it just one house or is it a commercial building? It's a commercial building, but the siding is going to be actually on the fourth floor. Oh, wow. So the entire fourth floor? Just on the side of the building. Okay. So not the front and back, just kind of like the left and right side. Oh, left and right. And what type of siding do you want to install? Just slab siding. I'm sorry, a slab? Yeah. Okay. All right, what city are you located? San Francisco. San Francisco, okay. All right, let me check my calendar. San Francisco, I do believe I have somebody out there on Monday. We can come out in the afternoon, say around 1 p.m. So actually, we're working on, it's basically under construction right now, and we're kind of working towards getting the exterior done. So it's still in the process. We just reached cement floor on the first floor, on the ground level. So we're just, basically we're going to start framing up, and so we pretty much are just collecting quotes to get the exterior done, if that makes sense. There's nothing to look at. I have the plans. Okay, so it's not built yet. Yeah, it's not built yet, but we're just aligning all the contractors to get the exterior done, if that makes sense. I see. Well, if that's the case, I think the best thing we can do right now is we need to see specifics. Like, I'm sure you have plans, right? Uh-huh, yeah, I have plans. If you could forward the plans to us, and then give us the exact specifications of the Scoble Fork, and then we'll take it from there. Okay, perfect. Can I get an email I can send the plans to? Yes, yes, it's office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Rhinobuilders1989. Rhinobuilders, builders is plural, right? Yeah, plural. Got it, so office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Yes. Okay, perfect. All right, let me go ahead and send the plans over, and please let me know if you have any questions. Yeah, what's your name? My name is Tree, it's spelled T-R-E-E. Okay, Tree, thank you so much, appreciate it. Thank you. Okay, you have a good one. You too, bye-bye. Bye-bye.\n",

We are in Lafayette, California. Okay. Yeah, I'm in San Francisco. Okay. All right. Let me just open my calendar. So we do have an opening tomorrow in San Francisco, right? So hold on. Yes. We do have an opening on Thursday at around 10 a.m. Will that work for you? Yeah. No, I'm not available. What's a good day for you? I can do Thursday, but not until after 4. Oh, no, we don't have anything after 4. Is that your daily schedule? I can do Monday, next Monday on the 26th, before 10 a.m. or after 11 a.m. Okay. Let's do Monday. That's going to be the 26th. I mean, after 9 or after 11. Is that what you said? After 11? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We can do like 11.30. Okay. Okay, perfect. All right. So can you please... Oh, by the way, what's the size of the wall that needs to be replaced? I don't know the exact size. It's not a rectangle. It's in a regular shape. But it's two stories high and then maybe like 25 feet wide for the longest part. But again, it's not a rectangle. Okay. And it's just going to be at the front part, the side, or the back? This is just the side of the house. Side. Okay. And what kind of siding do you want to replace it with? Well, I'm open to ideas. Right now it's vinyl, and I don't think I want vinyl because the vinyl is just not holding up. The side of the house gets a lot of...it gets hit by the weather really intensely, like rain and wind. So yeah, something probably a little bit sturdier. Okay. That sounds good. Can I please get the property address? Yeah. It's 265 Minerva, M-I-N-E-R-V-A. Is that street? Yeah, street. And then can I just confirm, because I found you guys on Google, but it says that your address is in San Francisco. So I'm confused if I like... Oh, those are just our satellite offices because we have little representatives all around. So we use those addresses. But our main office is in Lafayette. But San Francisco, we do call it San Francisco. Yeah. Okay. Okay, 265 Minerva Street, San Francisco. And what's the best phone number to reach you at? 415-609-7597. So 415-609-7597. And can I get your first and last name, please? Rachel, R-A-C-H-E-L. And my last name is Forbes, F-O-R-B-E-S. Thank you. And lastly, what's your email address? It's Rachel, R-A-C-H-E-L, period, Catherine, C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, period, Forbes, F-O-R-B-E-S, at gmail.com. Perfect. All right, thank you so much. So I'm going to schedule you for Monday the 26th at 1130 a.m., okay? Okay, thank you. And I will be sending you a text confirmation for this appointment. All right? Okay, sounds good. All right, thanks. Thank you. Thanks, Rachel. Have a good one. Bye. \n",

And I got this number from Chad, he's a contractor for Shea Homes. And I was just calling to see, I don't know exactly what your company does. I don't know if we need a moisture barrier or actually try and put a sump pump in or what we need to do, but it's concerning because I can start to see some damage to the foundation, the stucco and stuff. So, we've always had a lot of moisture under the house. We live in the bottom of the canyon. So, anyway, if you can give me a call back, I'd appreciate it. Again, my number is 925-525-6221. And my name is Dan Marciel. Thank you so much. Bye.\n",

Sometimes it's easier for business owners to speak on a Saturday, but just want to reach out, tell you about us, see if we could be of service this year. We are merger and acquisition advisors and business brokers. I've been in the industry for over 20 years. We start what's called a market valuation exit plan document, which is the first step for us in working with clients. And really it's more than just evaluation. It's a roadmap to your exit of your business. Most business owners have never planned for their exit, leaving a lot of questions unanswered and money on the table. I'd love to share a sample copy of that with you. The other thing is we are also uniquely qualified in commercial real estate. We're affiliated with Sperry, which is a national company on commercial real estate side. So if your concrete ready mix company includes real estate, we can really help you with that as well if it's part of the business. But anyway, give me a call when you get a chance.

And I've got a problem with the San Francisco Assessor's Office right now because they say the project was never closed out. And I've got proof that I've actually paid the inspection fees. You guys are listed as being the agents who actually filed for the permits. I wonder if you could have someone call me and so we can discuss this. The application in question was actually in April of 2018. And the permit number was 2018-0404-5588. 06. And I was wondering if there was a way you could possibly close it out for us or whatever. Because the San Francisco Assessor's Office says I've got to reopen the permit in order to close it, which doesn't make any sense at all. So again, my name is Mike Brown. My address was 1031 Treat Avenue, San Francisco, 94110. And my phone number is 415-206-1386. Hope to hear from you. Thank you, bye.\n",

I need to replace some siding. Why not replace and install new siding and some windows. I just wanted to see if you guys were interested in the project. You mentioned you're a GC? Yes. Okay. So I don't think it's going to work for us because we're also GCs and you know same thing with you. We're also going to be subbing our stuff up. Okay. So you guys don't do the siding directly? No. We did not. Okay. I mean a lot of times I can't hire a siding guy or window guy directly because they don't carry the insurance. We're pretty big GC. We do a lot of fire restoration and insurance repair. If you're willing to. I mean I've got it for the plans. If you want to take a look at it and let me know what you guys can bid on. I don't have a problem doing it that way. But I do ask that you give me a price for your roofing. Give me a price for framing. Give me a price for windows and doors. Kind of separate it all. Even paint. Whatever you want to bid on. I don't have a problem with it. If you guys are interested. But we may not be able to give you all the project. Or we say hey you're a little high on this number. I've got this other contractor that can do it for this much. Can you match that number and then we give you the whole project. We can work it out that way. But it's just really as long as we're within our budget. We don't have a problem hiring a GC to work under us. Okay just send us the email and then we'll take a look at it. And we'll take it from there. Okay what was your name again? Vivian. Vivian? And what's a what's a good email for you? It's office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Rhino builders? 1989.com. Hello? Yeah I got it. So office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Yeah. Okay. And what all do you guys do? Just so I can put this down in my notes. I'm just trying to keep track. Yeah we do everything. We also build houses from scratch. Okay. I mean this is technically what it is. We're rebuilding it from the ground up. Oh okay. And what city? It has fire. It's on Leandro. Oh it's on Leandro. Okay. So it's not too far from you guys. I pulled you guys up on on Google Maps. And then at least take a look at it and see if you guys would be interested. And then we can go from there. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah I'll keep an eye on that email. Okay. Thank you Vivian.

I was actually searching for concrete contractor in the area and came across Rhino Retaining Walls and Pavers. I can see that you guys provided fantastic service with five stars rating on your page, so congratulations. However, only a few reviews here on your page, so I'm just wondering if you normally ask your customers to have a review or you simply leave it up to them. I don't know. What exactly is the purpose of your call? I don't understand what your purpose is. Yeah. Actually, I'm not sure if you're aware that you rated five stars on your Google page. Am I talking to the owner? No, you're not. But what is the purpose of your call? I can address it. Yeah. It's actually, as I mentioned earlier, it's actually the Google page. We know that. We'll just send an email. Yes, we know that. Yeah, we'll just send an email directly to the owner. Okay. Thank you for your time. Have a good day. All right. \n",

Yes, I can send you a quote for the PG&E work. We're PG&E certified. I haven't really looked at the job, but I was going to go drive by today. It's right down the street from my house. Oh, nice. All right. Do you have the plans that I sent to Oscar? I do. I have the plans and the write-up of all the details, so I'll take a look at it. I mainly just wanted to introduce myself, and then I'll get back with you if I have any questions and try to get you guys something submitted over the weekend. All right. Nice. Sorry.

      "transcript": "Hello, this is Roli. Hello, this is Andrea calling from ViewRail. I'm responding to a form submission for a cable railing quote request that we received on the ViewRail website. Yes, from Shea. Okay. I was just calling to follow up on that a little bit. The next thing that we would need as far as getting a formal quote together would be some additional information about that. But I can start out by sending a follow-up email with some of the information about our system. Some of the details don't line up 100% with what was requested, but I can show you what we do have and what our options are. And that would also include a list of additional information that would help us to build out a formal quote. Can I send out a floor plan for you guys to use for reference? Can you send out a what? A what? We have floor plans of the house. Oh, perfect. Yes, that would be exactly what we would need as long as there's something on it that we can scale if the measurements aren't on there specifically. And then yes, we could go ahead based on that. Can I ask you some detail type questions about the project? I'm not sure if I can answer those, but okay. All right. You'll do your best, right? Yeah. I did see that they are requesting specifically all black hardware, and it says black cable. Do you know, do they want everything black? Yes, they want everything black. Okay. Then I would recommend that we give you a quote for our Onyx rod system. We don't have a black cable option because it's been our experience that whatever you use to make the cable black eventually wears off just because of the flexibility of the cable. But we do have a quarter inch, so similar profile, quarter inch stainless steel rod that is powder coated black. And that would be, you know, we can send it with a black post, black hardware, black infill and everything. But that doesn't wear it off, right? Or you're just saying what does it mean? Well, it comes with a five year finish warranty. And I'm looking here. Oh, discovery base. So it is not anywhere near the Pacific Ocean. And with it's within five miles of the Pacific Ocean, we do have some additional things that we can do to help preserve the life of the railing. But no, it's a powder coat, so it has really good lasting ability because it's on a stable one quarter inch rod as opposed to a cable that flexes. That would just be what I would recommend to have a totally black system, to have the black infill and the black post and the black handrail. I'll try to speak with the owner of the house if they're hoping for the cable to be, you know, not black. If he's stubborn about it, then we'll go with that. Right. Well, I'll send in that email. Do you want me to include you on it as well or will it go to you if I send it to the email and file at my role? Yeah, that's me. My role, Rhino Builders. OK, that was the email that was given then. And then just the shade was the name. I'll include a railing buyer's guide that will outline some of those options. And I'll also include our ICC report. That's our strength and safety testing for our system for some additional review. And then if you send the plans, we can go ahead and sort of preemptively prepare a quote for black onyx rods and go from there. OK. Once you send in that email, I'll also send in the floor plans. What was that last part? I'll also send back the floor plans. Perfect. Perfect. OK. That sounds good. And is there a specific timeline on this? Are they looking to move super quickly or within the next month? OK. Very good. All right. That sounds good. I will go ahead and get this introductory email and information out to you. And then when we get that plan back, we can work on that quote. All right. OK. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye. All right. Bye.\n",

Yeah, it's time for 1099s. I know. Oh, I didn't reply to the email. We'll be doing our own 1099, Sarkis. Okay, yeah. Moving forward or do you want me to never follow up on 1099s? Well, you can follow up. I mean, we'll never know if Shai will change his mind, you know. Yeah, yeah. Honestly, that's completely fine by me. I hate 1099s. I'm kidding. I'm always happy to do it, but you know, if you need help, let me know. But for now, I'm just going to take client role. Oh, I wish I could ask for your help, but then not for it. How many do you usually have? It's not much. Um, quite a number. You have everything you put in QuickBooks? Yeah, but everything is in QuickBooks. I can just run it. Yeah, but just make sure that you complete all the information. Oh, yeah, plenty. You have like 34, 35 between events. Yeah, and I think I'm going to still add up to that number. I'm not done yet. Beautiful. Good luck. Let me know if you need help. The deadline is the 31st of this month, so you have two weeks ahead of you. And the W-2 deadline is on February 2nd, correct? Yes, but, you know, better send it out in January, end of January, you know. Yeah, but our W-2 is hooked up with QuickBooks and it says automatic filing on February 2nd. Yeah, that's the last day. So, I don't know because 31st is on Saturday. So, usually they extend it to the next Monday. I see. Okay. As long as, you know, it's connected to QuickBooks, it's automatic. That's fine with me. Make sure they file it. If they don't file it by mistake or any error, you get a civil penalty. But can I file it ahead of time? Yeah, of course. I think QuickBooks allows you to file it ahead of time because you get a civil penalty if you don't file a W-2. They're very strict about that. Alrighty. Okay. We'll do. Thanks so much. Appreciate your help. Sounds good. Okay. Have a good one. You too. Bye-bye.\n",

Is that something you guys offer? Hello? Yeah, concrete, what are you asking for? So, I'm new to the area. I'm looking for somebody to help me. I need an estimate on re-slabbing the concrete on my front driveway and then towards the back RV access to the backyard. Is that something you guys do? It's all just, it'll just be a plain slab, no stamp, nothing special, just slab it out. So, it's going to, it's already slabbed out. It's just kind of messed up and cracked and it's been, you know, it's been like this for a while. It's kind of a mess. I'm trying to see if I can get something out of here. Do you want to redo the whole thing or just cover the areas that are not, you know, that are? That would be a, I mean, yeah, either the whole thing or maybe portions. That'd be the, when they get here, they can give me a better explanation on what they can, what was possible. Because it's a unique property. It's not like it's, it's not your typical just front driveway deal. It has a kind of odd. Okay. What city are you located? Martinez. In Martinez? Okay. Can I get the address, please? Come on, folks. Come on. It's 145 Hillside Lane. Okay, Martinez. Okay. All righty. Let me check my calendar. Let me see here. So we do have an opening either later today or tomorrow afternoon.

Yes. Yeah, we should be there at around 1230. 1230. Okay. Yeah. Sooner the better. It's fine.

      "transcript": "Hello. Hi, Roli and Jamie. I'm sure you knew that. I know. Anyway, I just got finished loading the machine calibrating. I'm waiting for all your files to download into this program. Estimated time is an hour and 18 minutes to print. Okay, that's fine. I'll just let my boss know that it will be around 10.30. 10.15 and the total will be 6.21 with everything. 6.21. Okay. And I want you to go online and look at $35.90 per page from FedEx. I did actually, yeah. So, we're all good. No, I'm hooking you all up. My wife just went in the room and I told her, I explained everything to her. She did not say one word to me. She just turned around and closed the door. So, that's what I just went through while I was waiting on the machine. Now, I'm just 65% downloading the PDFs into the program so I could size them and then start printing. My printer told me an hour and 18 minutes, but it'll probably be an hour and five because it does the cool down shit. But since these are blueprints, I don't have to wait for like the ink to dry like I do on canvas or, you know, because I could print anything. Foam boards when you need signs for, you know, construction. Oh, you do. I see because we also need signs, but I'm guessing you're really pretty busy. So, I'm not sure if we can do that. Well, no. If you've got the money, I got the time. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah. I'm in the process of building boats. Did you ever go to my website? No, you didn't. I have to know what your website is. Can you send a link? Discoverybayprint.com. I see now why your company comes up first because that's the name, Discovery Bay Print, because that's how people usually type, just in your area. Okay, I see it. Well, you can see all the stuff I do. Like, go scroll down and you'll see the signs. In fact, I got a lot of, you know, I'm just not a little blueprint. No, I do some shit like signs that are 10, 15 foot in diameter, 100 foot in the air, that weigh thousands of pounds. And yeah. And if you go down to the boat one, you'll see the boats. They do vehicle wraps. All right. I'll let my boss know because I'm pretty sure he has a lot to print for construction and it's just around Discovery Bay. Like any sign, even I go like right now, I'm doing a sign for a supermarket in Alameda. And it's Neptune Plaza. I do web designs and all that good stuff. Anything advertisement, printing and signs. So does he do commercial or is he just focusing on residential right now? It's only for residential for now. I'm not sure in the future, but. Yeah, I'll get you some residents. Like me, I'm like for my buddy, my business partner in the boat, I'm building his ADU. Like, I'll go in there and in one week build an ADU for about seven grand. And everybody, dude, you can't do that. I'll fucking bat me in. With a smart toilet, with a smart toilet, you know, all frigging LED lighting. With seven grand. Yeah. And my buddy, before I helped him out, he had this guy, Daniel, helping him out. He charged him $22,000 for a 10 by 12 ADU with a bathroom that's crooked. I was like, dude, man, I'm going to build your ADU, the whole thing with a loft for less than 20K. And your bathroom is going to be, again, like superior compared to the other one, which it is. Are you sure about that? I think it's quite, well, it's affordable, it's cheap. Yeah, because if you know how to build, 70% of construction is in labor. It's true. So if my job, if it costs me 300 bucks to do something on construction, I'm charging you $1,000. So if I'm buying $300 worth of material, I'm charging you $1,000. If I go spend $500 in material, I'm charging you $1,500. That's how I calculate. And then if there's anything- But I'm not going to disclose that. Difficult, very difficult. No, it just depends. I could walk into a room and say, okay, I know when I tear apart that wall, all the electrical and plumbing's running through there. I know I'm going to have to cut the floor. My brain already dissects things when I walk into the room and I'm, you know, okay, you want this, this. I look at a plan and I'll be like, dude, we can't put the bathroom here. The bathroom needs to go over there. Why? Because then I got to run pipes all the way around the room and blah, blah, blah. Yeah, there's a lot to consider. You know, I could walk into a house. I don't even have to. I just, long as I know what side the utilities come on, where the clean out for the septic is, or the drainage for their house, I'll tell you where all the pipes run. Pretty much you can tell where everything goes. It's just common sense. If you're building, it's like, okay, I wouldn't run it this way and this way when, you know, the standards are this and this. You know, if you know the basics and the standards, then you could walk in somewhere. And not many people do that. I do. Are you an architect? Because I, I engineered security systems for, you know, major, you know, big companies. I'd go in there and set up hundreds of cameras, access control, you know, intercom systems, biometrics. I started off years ago doing regular. And then one day I got calls from all these grow companies up in Seattle and Oregon. And then for a few years worked my way all the way down here. And then one day on the way back from work in Oakland, from a warehouse I was doing there, I got into a accident, a dump truck from fucking Livermore pools and spas. The dude was on his phone and he hit me at like 60 miles an hour and broke my spine. So I was out of work for years and I couldn't get back into security because, you know, it's, it's a lot of clients, a lot of physical labor. So I wound up just buying a bunch of print stuff. And still like, like this is the first year that I've gone where I've had no major physical problem. I get back aches every once in a while, but. That sounds great. That sounds great. Usually it's, it comes and goes there, but I've had seven spine surgeries. It's, it was bad. It sucked. I'm telling you, it was miserable. And in the middle of that. So it was, it was a rough, it was a rough few years, you know, not working and all that good stuff too. And right now you're being a workaholic with all the printing and all the construction. Yeah. Now, now, especially since I, since I'm, you know, physically able to do other things. Now I'm installing cameras, I'm, I'm building signs. Now I got, I'm stuck with a couple of different types of businesses. You're multitasking now, there's a lot to do. Plus, if you go into services on my webpage, you go down and you'll see a link to my wife's website and you'll see all her, because she does music and artwork and, and that's what she does. So what a proactive team. She's, yeah, she's the one with all the power though. I'll, I'll inform my boss about the time. I'll let him know just maybe 10 minutes. As we speak, as we speak, I'm down and this thing is taking so, like, it is a, it's a very large file, but I think, I think I got it. Yeah. I'm, I'm looking at it here. I had to like micro, you know, reduce it so small so I can see all the files at one time and then I'll grab them. I'll start printing, but the printer just finished calibrating. As I was talking to you, I heard it just like, now it's going to be ready to go. It's not easy. Like if somebody comes and says they want vinyl stickers, it's going to take me nearly an hour and a half to change the paper, put the paper in, calibrate it for that substrate. It's, it's not easy. That's what I'm saying. I had to set up for, for vinyl. I was doing vinyl the other, the other day. And so when you called me this morning, I was already prepared to start changing. I was drinking my coffee like dragon, but I was like, God, I was going to do it last night. I was too, we moved like two trailers, a bunch of forklifts, all these frigging four wheeling quads. Some of them didn't work. So we were pushing them up the trail. I was like, yeah, I don't need this. I'm getting too old for this. I got my workout. I'll be, I'll be 58 on the 16th of January. I don't, I don't look at everybody thinks I'm in my forties. You sound around like early forties to me. Yeah. Everybody says, dude, you don't look that. And I was looking pictures of my friends, man. My friends don't send me pictures of the reunion and stuff. Uh, school, like when we were younger, half the people are dead, but all the other people are really old, like really old. But like, Whoa, that's scary. It must be the genes. Right. And some healthy, healthy living diet. Yeah. I just love me. That's all it takes. Self-love. You just need to love yourself. I need to, um, your buddy will love you. Yup. But anyway, I'm going to get working on this. I'm going to have to do it. Yeah. This is like taken. Wow. You know what it is? All the info on there. It's like a lot of detail. It's like almost thing as the fricking picture. It's weird. Now let me see if I go into cut. It took like two months for the designer to finish that. And it's kind of suspicious because with our in house designer, it takes like a week or, and it's actually better, but it's the owner's, um, designer. So we have no choice. We just need to listen. Yeah. Next time go to Grok. Grok designed me a beautiful wardrobe. I don't know how he found these, um, designers, but Hey, he says yes. So let's go, let's go with that. It took him two months. Oh my gosh. And now the project delayed and people are pointing fingers. So anyway, putting that aside, we need to push forward. Ma'am. Anyway, I'm, I am, uh, working on this, so I should, you know, it should take me about, or here we go. The production manager, Jesus, 20. Yeah. I need to work on getting the finished materials for these two. Um, anyway, thank you. You're welcome. I'm sure that you're really busy with some other stuff. No, I just got a bunch of projects going on and it's like the last minute thing. I usually don't do, but I remember, uh, meeting your boss that day after you called me, he came by. He's, he's pretty cool. That's my, my new Israeli, new Israeli ally right there. You know, I can be broke. He's, he's like that. No, he's, he's, he's a cool guy. I already, I already tell, you know, we hit it off as soon as he, as soon as he, I was like, dude, okay, I like you. And I thought, I was like, all right, I'll do this for you. You know, and when I seen your message yet, you know, yesterday I was like, oh man, it took him a long time to get back to me. He said, I'll call you next week. I'll call you next week. He said, I'll call you next week. I got to need someone like, okay, call me next week. No, but you know, the designer has got the lid. So this is the week that he met. Yep. All right. I am, I am going to start printing this out. You might need to get doing some work done over here. Thank you so much. As soon as I'm finished with this, I'll send you a text and let you know. I don't have his number. I never got his number from him. So. I can give you his number if you need to call him. If you want to text it to me, I could get it when he's going to be here to pick this up anyway. Alrighty then. Thank you so much for your time. And I appreciate you remembering me to do this work. That's awesome. Yeah. Since you're just nearby, why not? Right? Okay. Yes, ma'am. But anyway, you have a great day. You too. Have a nice day. Thanks.\n",
