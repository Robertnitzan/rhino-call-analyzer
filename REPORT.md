## Key Findings

### 1. Spam Problem is Costing You Time

**362 spam calls** consumed approximately **3 hours and 9 minutes** of phone time over 5 months. That's time Roly and the team spent answering calls from:
- "Digital activation department" scammers
- Google listing verification scams
- EMG listings spam
- SEO marketing cold calls
- QuickBooks payment scams
- Business lending offers

**Top spam patterns:**
- "Press 1 to verify your Google listing" - automated robocalls
- "This is [name] from digital activation department" - repeated daily
- "Google Voice searches" scam - same caller ID, same script

### 2. 28% of Calls Go Nowhere

231 calls were INCOMPLETE - the caller either:
- Hung up before speaking
- Didn't leave a voicemail
- Said "hello" once and disconnected
- Had audio too garbled to understand

**This suggests:** Callers may be abandoning due to hold times or unclear IVR prompts.

### 3. Your Real Customer Lead Rate is 7.5%

Only 63 out of 839 calls were actual customers asking about:
- Concrete driveways and patios
- Foundation repairs
- ADU construction
- Bathroom/kitchen remodels
- Drainage systems
- Retaining walls

**Average customer call duration: 3+ minutes** (189 seconds) - these are engaged callers with real projects.

### 4. You're Losing Leads Outside Service Area

25 calls (NOT_FIT) were potential customers but:
- From Santa Rosa, Windsor, Vacaville, Gilroy - outside Bay Area
- Asking for services Rhino doesn't offer (mobile homes, drain cleaning)
- Jobs too small (single screen door, etc.)

**Consider:** Adding service area info to Google listings to reduce these calls.

### 5. Which Phone Numbers Perform Best?

**Highest customer leads:**
| Source | Customers | Spam | Lead Quality |
|--------|-----------|------|--------------|
| Orinda GMB | 16 | 69 | 19% leads |
| Lafayette GMB | 10 | 52 | 16% leads |
| Rhino Concrete Oakland | 10 | 26 | 28% leads |
| Rhino Drainage Bay Area | 4 | 17 | 19% leads |

**Rhino Concrete Oakland has the best lead-to-spam ratio** - 28% of calls are real customers.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Block known spam numbers** - Same callers hit multiple lines daily. The "Google Voice searches" spam comes from the same number pool.

2. **Screen "press 1" robocalls** - 43% of spam starts with "press 1 to speak to an agent." These can be auto-blocked.

3. **Update voicemail prompt** - 231 incomplete calls suggest callers give up. Consider shorter hold message or callback option.

### Longer Term

4. **Add service area to Google listings** - "Serving Oakland, Berkeley, Lafayette, Orinda, Danville, Pleasanton" - reduces NOT_FIT calls.

5. **Track lead sources better** - Orinda GMB brings the most customers (16) but also the most spam (69). Worth investigating if the listing is attracting bots.

6. **Consider call screening service** - With 43% spam rate, a service like CallRail's spam detection or a dedicated receptionist could filter junk calls.

## How This Data Was Analyzed

Every call was manually reviewed by AI (Claude) reading the actual transcripts. Each call received:
- A one-sentence summary of what happened
- A category classification based on content, not keywords

This is different from automated spam detection - we read what was actually said to ensure accuracy.
