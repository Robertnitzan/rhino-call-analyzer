*Digital Activation Department:*
> "Hello, this is Rose from the digital activation department..."
(Same script, different names: Kelly, Ayla, Sabrina)

*EMG Listings:*
> "This is EMG listing department calling about your business listing..."

*Cold Calls:*
> "Hi, this is Kevin with InnoDesk Engineering. I was just reaching out to see if you all have any new projects that require MEP or structural civil engineering..."

---

### INCOMPLETE (231 calls)
Calls where we couldn't determine what the caller wanted because:

1. **Caller hung up immediately** (4-8 seconds)
   - "Hello? Hello?" → disconnect
   - Brief greeting, no response from caller

2. **Hold message only** (10-30 seconds)
   - "Please hold for the next available agent..." → caller disconnected
   - Never reached a conversation

3. **Voicemail prompt, no message**
   - "Please leave your name and number..." → caller hung up without leaving message

4. **Audio issues**
   - Garbled/unclear audio
   - Background noise, can't understand

**Examples from actual calls:**
- "Brief greeting with no content" (8 seconds)
- "Hold message only no conversation" (15 seconds)
- "Voicemail greeting no message left" (22 seconds)
- "Garbled conversation with no clear purpose" (45 seconds)
- "Short call - Roly answered then hello hello no response" (12 seconds)

**Why this matters:** 231 calls (28%) resulted in zero information. These could be:
- Customers who gave up waiting
- Wrong numbers
- Spam calls that disconnected
- Poor cell phone connections

---

### OPERATIONS (134 calls)
Legitimate business calls that aren't customer leads:

**Suppliers & Materials:**
- "Westside Building Material payment for stucco materials"
- "Material payment for 4 yards shirted red"
- "Home Depot Concord payment call - Rudy materials for 7 Skander Court"

**Permits & City:**
- "City of Lafayette permit call about erosion control at 1099 Via Media"
- "Real estate disclosures for Carmen Court via Glide"

**Subcontractors & Job Seekers:**
- "Job seeker inquiring about employment"
- "Drywall worker seeking employment"
- "German looking for drywall work - added to subcontractor list"
- "Palisade Builders GC bidding opportunity for Glen at Heather Farms"

**Internal:**
- "Internal call - Rolly refresh check"
- "Brief internal call with Vivian"

---

### NOT_FIT (25 calls)
Real potential customers, but Rhino couldn't help them:

**Outside Service Area:**
- "Bathroom remodel inquiry from Windsor - outside service area"
- "Foundation work inquiry from Santa Rosa - outside service area"
- "Post tension slab GPR survey inquiry from Gilroy - outside service area"
- "Eaton fire repair bid - Altadena CA - outside service area"
- "San Rafael concrete inquiry - outside service area"

**Service Not Offered:**
- "Mobile home material inquiry - not service offered"
- "Window insulation/condensation issue - Rhino only does replacement not repair"
- "Caller asking about drainage cleaning service - Rhino only installs not cleans"
- "Kitchen hood job in Orinda too small - referred to handyman"

**Declined:**
- "Sidewalk replacement Oakland - declined subcontractor to subcontractor work"
- "Commercial saw cutting inquiry - not service offered"

---

### SYSTEM (22 calls)
Automated system calls, not spam:

- **Houzz Lead Notifications:** "As a courtesy, we call to see if you'd like to immediately respond to this homeowner over the phone. Press 1 to connect..."
- **Test Calls:** "Colorado technical support test call"
- **IVR Systems:** Automated lead routing, press-to-connect services

These are legitimate but not customer conversations.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Spam is Costing You 3+ Hours Per Month

**362 spam calls** consumed approximately **3 hours and 9 minutes** of phone time over 5 months. The team had to:
- Answer the call
- Listen to the pitch
- Say "no thank you"
- Hang up

This adds up to real labor cost and distraction from actual work.

### 2. Google Listing Scams are the #1 Problem

158 calls (44% of all spam) were Google listing scams. They all follow the same pattern:
- Robocall intro: "This is an important message about your Google Business..."
- Scare tactic: "Clients are having trouble finding you..."
- Call to action: "Press 1 to speak to an agent..."

**These are NOT from Google.** They're scammers trying to sell fake SEO services.

### 3. 28% of Callers Abandon Before Speaking

231 incomplete calls suggest potential issues with:
- Hold times too long
- IVR menu confusing
- Voicemail prompt too lengthy
- Callers expecting instant answer

### 4. Best Performing Phone Lines

| Source | Total | Customers | Spam | Customer Rate |
|--------|-------|-----------|------|---------------|
| Rhino Concrete Oakland | 36 | 10 | 26 | **28%** |
| ROLLE- Lead Center | 27 | 7 | 0 | **26%** |
| Orinda GMB | 101 | 16 | 69 | 16% |
| Lafayette GMB | 90 | 10 | 52 | 11% |

**Rhino Concrete Oakland** has the best lead quality - nearly 1 in 3 calls is a real customer.

### 5. Lost Opportunities Outside Service Area

25 potential customers called from areas Rhino doesn't serve:
- Santa Rosa / Windsor (6 calls)
- Vacaville (2 calls)
- Gilroy (1 call)
- Altadena (2 calls - fire damage)
- San Rafael (1 call)

**Recommendation:** Add clear service area to Google listings to prevent these calls.

## Monthly Trend

| Month | Total | Spam | Customer | Spam Rate |
|-------|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| Oct 2025 | 275 | 125 | 18 | 45% |
| Nov 2025 | 172 | 71 | 15 | 41% |
| Dec 2025 | 150 | 63 | 11 | 42% |
| Jan 2026 | 222 | 96 | 17 | 43% |
| Feb 2026 | 20 | 7 | 2 | 35% |

Spam rate is consistent at ~43%. No seasonal improvement.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Block known spam patterns** - "Digital activation department" and "EMG listings" calls come from identifiable number pools.

2. **Auto-reject "press 1" robocalls** - 38 calls were pure robocalls. CallRail or phone system can filter these.

3. **Shorten hold message** - Current message may be too long. Consider: "Rhino Builders, please hold briefly" (5 seconds max).

### Longer Term

4. **Add service area to Google listings** - Include "Serving Oakland, Berkeley, Lafayette, Orinda, Danville, Walnut Creek, Pleasanton, Livermore" to reduce NOT_FIT calls.

5. **Track incomplete calls** - Consider callback system for callers who hang up during hold.

6. **Review Orinda GMB listing** - It brings the most leads (16) but also the most spam (69). May be attracting bot traffic.

## Methodology

Every call was manually reviewed by AI (Claude) reading the actual transcripts from CallRail. Each call received:

1. **Full transcript review** - Not keyword matching, but understanding context
2. **One-sentence summary** - What actually happened on the call
3. **Category assignment** - Based on caller intent and outcome

This approach catches nuances that automated spam detection misses:
- A "Google" call might be spam OR a real Google My Business support call
- A short call might be spam OR a customer who got their question answered quickly
- A sales call might be spam OR a legitimate subcontractor offering services

**Total processing:** 839 calls with transcripts analyzed individually.
