  "transcription": "Hi, did you get that e-mail I sent you? Yes, I did. I sent it to my boss and he says we'll have it for another time. Okay. So just don't worry about it now. Yeah. Okay. And also on your letterhead here on the thing you sent over, it looks like you're at 3685 Mount Diablo Boulevard. Is that your correct address? Our office address? Yeah. Hold on, let me. Because here in the system I got you under 8 Westwood Court Orenda. Oh, that's our boss' house. Okay. Okay. No, it's fine. I just saw here where it was under Lafayette and then I saw here in the system it was something else. Okay, yeah, don't worry about it. Okay, so I'll just disregard this and we will, you know, you can just let us know if you need us to do anything later. Okay, it's all good. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye.\n",
