  "transcription": "Hello, good morning. Hello, I'm hoping to speak to Reina Gomez. Oh, she's no longer working with us. Oh, my apologies. The file must be out of date. The reason I'm calling is about possible credits for the business regarding the merchant account. Do you know who makes the decisions considering that? Oh, no, we're good. We don't need that right now. I understand. Am I speaking to the person who's in charge of that? As I said, we don't need that right now, so thank you.\n",
