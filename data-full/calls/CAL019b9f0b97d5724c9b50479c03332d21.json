  "transcription": "Hello, good morning. Hi. My name is Stephanie. I was looking for Moore Perez. Moore is not available, Maynard. I mean, what is it about, Stephanie? Well, I'm from the Aspire Institute. We have a business management workshop coming up at San Ramon, so we're kind of reaching out to our GCs and seeing how things are going out there. Okay, I will let her know. Okay, I have office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Is that a good email? Yeah. Okay. If you just let them know that, like, I'm going to send out this email real quick, and it could potentially end up in their junk mail, and it's all of my contact information is at the very bottom. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye.\n",
