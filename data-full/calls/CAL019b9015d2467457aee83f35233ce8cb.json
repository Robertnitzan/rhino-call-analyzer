  "transcription": "Hi, good afternoon. This is Steve with Yelp, trying to reach you about the Rhino Builders Yelp account since we've had 37,000 people looking for a general contractor in December, but only 19 of them had a chance to contact you. So please give me a call when you get this. Let's get this turned around and working for you. My phone number is 480-207-5712. Thank you.\n",
