  "transcription": "Hello. Good morning. Good morning. This is Joe. How are you doing today? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm fine. Thanks for asking. Is this a good time to talk with you? No. I'm in the middle of something, actually. Oh, okay. Should I call you later? What is it about? Actually, it's just a quick call from my site. I just wanted to see if you're looking to bid on a project where you need cost estimation. Are you a homeowner? No, no. I'm from an estimating company. Oh, okay. No, we're good. We have that covered. Thank you. Okay.\n",
