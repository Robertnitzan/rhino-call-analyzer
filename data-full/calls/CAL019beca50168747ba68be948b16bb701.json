  "transcription": "Builders. Please hold for the next available agent. Hello, good afternoon. Is this Rinova Builders? All right, Rinoa Builders. How can I help? Yes, we have a job that we would like to see if you're interested in. It's a kitchen and bath refresh and it's in Arenda. It's in Arenda, all right. Have you spoken to a designer already? Do you have plans available or is it? Well, it's not something that needs plans. It's reface the cabinets, put in a backsplash new counter, and probably some cabinet drawer work. And then in the bathroom, it's removing a tub and then essentially retiling. That's sort of what it is. Got it. And okay, yeah, we can definitely give you an estimate for that. So what we normally do is that we would like to do a site visit so we can, you know, like evaluate the existing conditions and we'll take it from there. So we do have an opening next week, say, Tuesday on the 27th. And it's going to be in the afternoon around, let's just say around 1 p.m. Will that work for you? That might be hard because I have to work in San Francisco. Oh, okay. So what's a good time for you? Either really early or really late. Okay. What's really late for you? You know, 5. 5 p.m.? 4.30, something like that. 5 p.m., yeah. Okay. Can we do like 4.30 instead? Sure. Okay. We can do 4.30 on Tuesday, the 27th. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. Just so you know, we've sort of settled on a color palette and other things. We just need to execute now. And it's something that I think needs a contractor's attention and we don't want to do it ourselves. Well, that's even better because all we have to do is just to put them all together. And you've already decided that. That's the harder part, actually, like choosing the finished material. Yeah, we spent like six weeks doing that. I know. Okay. So can I please get your first and last name? Don Kavanaugh. K-A-V-A-N-A-G-H. Oh, N-A-G-H. Okay. All right. Thank you. And what's the best number to reach you, Don? 415. 2775-0471. All right. And what's the property address? 221 Village Gate Road. Arenda? Yes. Sorry. Okay. All right. What's your email address? It's Don.Kavanaugh. And I'll spell it again. K-A-V-A, like Victor. K-A-V-A-N-A-G-H. At gmail.com. Perfect. All right. Perfect. So I'll set you up for Tuesday. That's going to be the 27th at 430 p.m. Okay? Yeah. That sounds good. I'll call you. I can't look at my calendar at the moment, but I'll call you back if there's any conflict. Yes. Yes, please do. And I'll send you a text confirmation for this appointment. Did you happen to do those on the weekends or just weekdays? Normally just weekdays. Okay. I'll work with that. Okay. All righty then. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. You too. Have a good one. Bye-bye. You too. Bye. All right. Bye.\n",
