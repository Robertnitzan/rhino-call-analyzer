  "transcription": "Builders. Please hold for the next available agent. Hello. Hi. Good morning. Hi. Sorry, I couldn't hear anything for a second. Yeah. How can I help? Well, this is Matt from Maps Machine. I know I'm an interruption here, but do you mind if I grab a half a minute? I'll let you know exactly why I called and then you can let me know if it's relevant to you. Actually, I'm very busy right now, Matt, so I can't. So just try again some other time. Okay? Sounds good. What's a good time of day to try? I don't know. I gotta go. Bye-bye.\n",
