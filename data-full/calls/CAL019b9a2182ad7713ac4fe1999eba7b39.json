  "transcription": "Hello. Good afternoon. Hey, good afternoon. Am I speaking to Lori? No, this is not Lori. Who's calling? This is Ace. We had a talk with Lori regarding RhinoBuilder's estimation work. We provide the estimation work, so I was just looking up the opportunity. Lori told us to contact you guys in January if you guys will be bidding, so we can help you in that regard. No, I think we're good in that area. Well, thanks for calling. Specific reason, like in-house team? What's that? Do you have the in-house team? That's the reason? Or should I follow up later? No, you do. Oh, okay, okay. I got it. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. All right. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.\n",
