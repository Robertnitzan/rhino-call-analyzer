  "transcription": "Good afternoon, my name is Mike Brown. Back in 2018, we did a bathroom remodel using smart modeling and design. And I've got a problem with the San Francisco Assessor's Office right now because they say the project was never closed out. And I've got proof that I've actually paid the inspection fees. You guys are listed as being the agents who actually filed for the permits. I wonder if you could have someone call me and so we can discuss this. The application in question was actually in April of 2018. And the permit number was 2018-0404-5588. 06. And I was wondering if there was a way you could possibly close it out for us or whatever. Because the San Francisco Assessor's Office says I've got to reopen the permit in order to close it, which doesn't make any sense at all. So again, my name is Mike Brown. My address was 1031 Treat Avenue, San Francisco, 94110. And my phone number is 415-206-1386. Hope to hear from you. Thank you, bye.\n",
