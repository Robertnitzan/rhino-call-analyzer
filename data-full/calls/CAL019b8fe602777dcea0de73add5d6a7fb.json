  "transcription": "Hello. Good morning. Hi. Good morning. It's Adriana with Quality Imaging. I was hoping to speak to the person that purchases the ink and toner for the printers. What is it about, Adriana? So we are an ink and toner manufacturer. We do carry the original shelf filled to max capacity, and right now we're having a trial where we can send you guys a couple of our products to test out. We do not require any billing information. Just want to see if we can earn your business and help you save money. Oh, yeah. Well, unfortunately, we don't really use our printer that much because we mostly work from home. Yeah, so it's not going to be like, yeah, it's not going to be using it that often. How often do you guys change the ink? I do not know. I don't go to the office. Okay. Thank you for letting me know. Have a great day. Thank you. Of course. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.\n",
