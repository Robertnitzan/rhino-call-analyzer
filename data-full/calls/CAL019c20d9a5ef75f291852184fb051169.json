  "transcription": "Please hold for the next available agent. This call is being recorded. Hello, this is Roly. Hey, this is Kevin with InnoDesk Engineering. How are you doing today? Oh, good. How may I help you? Yeah, I was just reaching out to see if you all have any new projects that require MEP or structural civil engineering. You may remember we've worked with your firm in the past, sent over proposals. So just wanted to see if you currently have anything in the works this year. Oh, right now, no, we are good now with our projects and our sub, but thanks for the call. Yeah, absolutely. We look forward to working with you if you have anything in the future. Thanks, Marla. Have a good one. Bye. You too. Bye.\n",
