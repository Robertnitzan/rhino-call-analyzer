  "transcription": "Hey, what's going on guys? My name is Rick over from the company Big Creek Lumber. I came to visit the 27 Ichabod Lane project that you guys are apparently working on and just wanted to shake a hand, meet whoever was responsible for purchasing your guys' materials itself. I just want to see if there might be an opportunity for us to work together, see if I can help you guys out on your next project. If anything, give me a call back. This is my direct line here at the office, 707-551-6219. I'll try you guys again a little bit later on today, but thank you. Hopefully hear from you guys soon. Bye.\n",
