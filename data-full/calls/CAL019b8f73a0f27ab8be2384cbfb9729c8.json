  "transcription": "Hello, good morning. Is this Rhino Builders? Yes, it is. Who's calling? Yeah, my name is Wes Fisher. I'm just wondering about the property at 226 Overhill and Orinda. It has your guys' sign with your guys' name on it, but it doesn't look like it's been worked on for a while. Is that? Yeah, we're no longer working on that property. The owner already, you know, stopped the work for us. You should take your sign off. It doesn't look good for you guys. Oh yeah, I have to tell my boss about it. Thank you for letting, thank you for calling about it. Okay, do you know why they stopped? Yeah, do you know why they stopped? Yeah, I don't have any idea why they stopped. Wow, it's a few years, right? I think so, yeah, I think so. It's been a while. I remember that property for like more than a year now. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay, I will let them know. Thank you so much. Yeah, have a good day. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.\n",
