  "transcription": "Builders. Please hold for the next available agent. Hello, good morning. Yes, is this Rhino Builders or Development? Yes, it is. May I know what you're calling? My name is Louis. I live in the Rinda area and that house you had on Overhill, I see you've got some fencing up. Is that still your project? Unfortunately, it's no longer our project. Okay, did that go back to a bank or a lender? Honestly, I don't have any idea about that. Okay. I was going to see who I could buy it from and finish it out as a general contractor myself, but maybe I will do a property search if he comes up with. Yep. Yeah, that would be good. Okay, thank you. Thank you.\n",
