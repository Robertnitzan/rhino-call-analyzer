  "transcription": "Yes, hi, this is Dan Marciel at 925-525-6221. We're having some issues with water, a lot of moisture under our house. And I got this number from Chad, he's a contractor for Shea Homes. And I was just calling to see, I don't know exactly what your company does. I don't know if we need a moisture barrier or actually try and put a sump pump in or what we need to do, but it's concerning because I can start to see some damage to the foundation, the stucco and stuff. So, we've always had a lot of moisture under the house. We live in the bottom of the canyon. So, anyway, if you can give me a call back, I'd appreciate it. Again, my number is 925-525-6221. And my name is Dan Marciel. Thank you so much. Bye.\n",
