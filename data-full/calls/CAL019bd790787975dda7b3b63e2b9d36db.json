I was searching for a concrete contractor when I came across your business page, Rhino Retaining Walls. I wanted to ask you, are you guys asking your customers to leave your reviews on your Google business page, or do you kind of just leave it up to the customer? We're not really interested for now, but thank you for calling.\n",
