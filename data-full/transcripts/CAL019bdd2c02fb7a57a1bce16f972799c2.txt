Please hold for the next available agent. Hi, I was just hoping to schedule a consultation for replacing some siding on my house. Siding? Yeah, sure. What city are you located? We are in Lafayette, California. Okay. Yeah, I'm in San Francisco. Okay. All right. Let me just open my calendar. So we do have an opening tomorrow in San Francisco, right? So hold on. Yes. We do have an opening on Thursday at around 10 a.m. Will that work for you? Yeah. No, I'm not available. What's a good day for you? I can do Thursday, but not until after 4. Oh, no, we don't have anything after 4. Is that your daily schedule? I can do Monday, next Monday on the 26th, before 10 a.m. or after 11 a.m. Okay. Let's do Monday. That's going to be the 26th. I mean, after 9 or after 11. Is that what you said? After 11? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We can do like 11.30. Okay. Okay, perfect. All right. So can you please... Oh, by the way, what's the size of the wall that needs to be replaced? I don't know the exact size. It's not a rectangle. It's in a regular shape. But it's two stories high and then maybe like 25 feet wide for the longest part. But again, it's not a rectangle. Okay. And it's just going to be at the front part, the side, or the back? This is just the side of the house. Side. Okay. And what kind of siding do you want to replace it with? Well, I'm open to ideas. Right now it's vinyl, and I don't think I want vinyl because the vinyl is just not holding up. The side of the house gets a lot of...it gets hit by the weather really intensely, like rain and wind. So yeah, something probably a little bit sturdier. Okay. That sounds good. Can I please get the property address? Yeah. It's 265 Minerva, M-I-N-E-R-V-A. Is that street? Yeah, street. And then can I just confirm, because I found you guys on Google, but it says that your address is in San Francisco. So I'm confused if I like... Oh, those are just our satellite offices because we have little representatives all around. So we use those addresses. But our main office is in Lafayette. But San Francisco, we do call it San Francisco. Yeah. Okay. Okay, 265 Minerva Street, San Francisco. And what's the best phone number to reach you at? 415-609-7597. So 415-609-7597. And can I get your first and last name, please? Rachel, R-A-C-H-E-L. And my last name is Forbes, F-O-R-B-E-S. Thank you. And lastly, what's your email address? It's Rachel, R-A-C-H-E-L, period, Catherine, C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, period, Forbes, F-O-R-B-E-S, at gmail.com. Perfect. All right, thank you so much. So I'm going to schedule you for Monday the 26th at 1130 a.m., okay? Okay, thank you. And I will be sending you a text confirmation for this appointment. All right? Okay, sounds good. All right, thanks. Thank you. Thanks, Rachel. Have a good one. Bye.
