holders. Please hold for the next available agent. Hello. Oh, hi there. Hi, I was wondering if it was possible to speak with more, please. My name is Colleen. Hi, my name is Sam. I'm calling on behalf of Red Oak Realty. How are you? Red Oak Realty. How can I help? Yeah, yeah. It was just a quick call. I'm working with Red Oak at the moment as they are creating their first relocation and lifestyle magazine. The agents will be using it to introduce new buyers and sellers to the area. And it's really kind of going to be something to show off the community and the lifestyle. So I was just calling to see if you might be interested in getting some details about featuring Rhino Builders in there as, of course, it aligns well with the clientele of Red Oak. And I thought it'd be a really good fit for you guys. Where is Red Oak at? So Red Oak Realty, they have four offices within the area. So you've got Oakland, Berkeley, El Cerrito and San Leandro. Oh, I see. Would they be areas that you focus on? As of the moment, we do have our marketing campaign. We already have started that ongoing. But you can just send us an email and if we would want to do that in the future, so we'll reach out. Of course. Yeah. What's the best email for me to send some details to? I sent one before, but I'm not sure if it was the right one. It's office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Perfect. Yes. So I have sent an email across with some details already. It may have just gone into junk or spam. But just so you are aware, I'm in the area week commencing the 2nd of February where I'll be hosting meetings to go through the opportunity and how it might be beneficial for businesses. So if that's of interest, once you've reviewed the email, let me know and I'd love to come and see you guys to talk about it in detail. All right. Sounds good. Fabulous. No problem. Well, any questions in the meantime, just let me know and I'll be happy to help. I have to go. I have another call. Thank you. Okay. All right. No problem. Bye. Thank you. Bye-bye. All right. Bye.
