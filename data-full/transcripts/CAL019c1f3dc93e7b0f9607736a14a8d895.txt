No builders. Please hold for the next available agent. This call is being recorded. Hello, this is Roli. Yes, hi. My name is Roy Roos, and I have a house in Santa Mona. The walkway part of the walkway has dropped about an inch and a half where it connects to the driveway, and I was hoping that I could get an estimate from you guys to lift that back up. Oh, sure thing. I just want to make sure, how many square meters, I mean square footage does that take, the walkway I mean? Well, the walkway, I don't know how to explain it. It's about two feet wide, maybe a little bit more than that, not much, and it's in sections with control joints at about 53 inches, and I think there's a couple of sections. As you pick it up, it goes back to the section behind it, right? But the one section that actually shows something is that 53 inches long by about two feet wide. I see. We're actually a general contractor, and we take big jobs. I don't think we can take this for now. I'm really sorry. Nothing small like that, huh? Yeah. Well, I have some other issues. There's a small portion of the driveway. That would be nice to level that out, and then there might be some foundation cracks that need to be filled. I see. Okay. I think we can check out the site, and let's see from there, from our project manager. When do you think is the best time for us to check the site? Well, I'm available mornings from around 1030 to around 1 o'clock. All right. Let me check our schedule. Hold on. Seems that we are free tomorrow at 11. Does that work? Actually, you know, that might be okay, tomorrow at 11. I'm getting a couple of different bids, and so I have another appointment that's a little bit earlier, so you'd be like after them about half an hour after they're done, I guess. Okay. All right. Can I take your address? Can I take your address? It's 9669 Thunderbird Drive. Thunderbird Drive. In San Ramon. San Ramon. Hold on. Let me double check. 9669. Right. Thunderbird Drive. All right. And what is your full name for us to put in there? Roy. Roy Roos. R-O-O-S. Got it. All right. And this is the best number for us to call back, right? Yes. All right. And that is 925-200-5109. And what time was that again? 11, did you say? Yes. Tomorrow at 11. 11. Okay. Yep. Hold on. Let me see. So, I have one question though before we do all of this. If I only decide to do that walkway area, that's going to be too small for you guys to do? That would be for our project manager to decide. Okay. Because there's a water line that goes under that would need to be protected, I guess. The water line, the main water line that feeds the house, I think that's what actually caused the problem. There was a leak some time ago. And it evacuated the soil underneath, I guess, some of it. And then slowly that little section of walkway keeps going down right over the top of the water line. And I'm afraid it's going to break the water line because it's a PVC water line. I see. Okay. I'll take a note on that. The water line underneath that needs to be protected. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, I would imagine it'd be nice to put maybe, I don't know, a piece of ABS pipe over the top of that water line when you when you inject the foam so the foam doesn't actually go all the way, you know what I mean, to keep the water line protected if that or something like that. I don't know. I'm just thinking about that as a thought. Okay. I took a note and then I'll let our project manager know. He can give you some advice when he's there. And then your email for us to send in the estimate. It's A-N-T-O-N-R-O-S-Z at A-T-T dot net. At A-T-T dot net. Okay. It's A-N-C-O-N-R-O-S-Z. No, not C. T-O-N. Anton Rose. A-N-T-O-N. A-N-T-O-N-R-O-S-Z at A-T-T dot net. That's it. All right. All right. I'll have someone over there by tomorrow at 11 a.m. All right. I'll be there. All right. Thank you, Roy. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
