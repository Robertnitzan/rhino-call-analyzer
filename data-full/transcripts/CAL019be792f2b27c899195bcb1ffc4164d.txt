Builders, please hold for the next available agent. This call is being recorded Hello. Hi, this is Manny at Ashby Lumber and Concord. Oh, hi, yes. Hi, I'm sorry? I have a delivery that I was working on with Selden. He asked me to reach out to Vivian, but I think I just missed her. He told me she was leaving at 1 for the payment. So this is Roli. Oh, hi, Roli. How are you? Just clocking in. So, okay, for which job is this again? This is for 1099 Via Medea. I sent it over to office. If you want, I can forward it over to you. And then if you want to just confirm it, and then you can let me know. Roli. I don't see it on our office. Hold on, let me wait for one of my emails. Yeah, I'll send it to you as well, just in case. I was going to try Clayton next, but I haven't talked to him in a while either, so I didn't know if he was around. He's not working with us anymore. Oh, he hasn't? Okay, yeah. I figured I'd try the landline or the main office line first. It still will get forwarded to either me or Vivian. Okay, okay, perfect. Okay, I see it. Received. I'll send this to, I think, the project manager. I'll confirm this with them, and then I'll let you know when we're going to do the payment. Perfect, perfect. Yeah, so we have it set up for tomorrow afternoon. As soon as you can, let me know. We just have to take care of it either today or, like, really early in the morning. Oh, okay. I'll call you, and then I'll let you know. Sounds good. No problem. Thank you very much. All right. Thank you. Thank you.
