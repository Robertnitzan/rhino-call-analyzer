--- TRANSCRIPT ---

Hello, good morning. Yes. I would like to get an estimate on an ADU. Okay. What kind of ADU? Is it detached or attached to the property? Detached. I already built one. I have two houses side-by-side. Between the two houses, I have three-quarters of an acre. I put one behind 2170, and now I got plenty of room to put another unit behind 2180, Elmenden Road. I would like to get an estimate and build the same like I did the first one, which is a really nice built. It's not a module or not a prefab. It's actual construction. Do you actually build them on-site? Yes, we do. Okay. What's the square footage of this ADU that you're thinking of? 1,050 square feet, two-bedroom, one-bath. All right. What city are you located? In San Jose. In San Jose. We do have an opening tomorrow. We have an opening tomorrow at around 10 or 11 in the morning. Will that work for you? Yes. Okay. Let's just do 10 a.m. What's that? We'll do 10 a.m. in the morning. Okay. 10 a.m. Can I please have your first and last name? Joe Simas, S-I-M-A-S. What's the property address, Joe? 2170 Elmenden Road. Okay. And what's the best number to reach you? 669-243-6028. Thank you. And lastly, what's your email address? joesimas at att.net. Perfect. Okay. So that's going to be joesimas at att.net. And I'm going to set you up for tomorrow, Joe, at 10 o'clock in the morning. And one of the guys will be there to give you an estimate. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. How long have you been in business, do you know? Oh, since 1989. Oh, wow. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. You have a good one. Okay. Bye-bye. All right. Bye.
