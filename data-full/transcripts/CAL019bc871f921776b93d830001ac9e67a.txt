Hello. Good afternoon. Hi. How are you doing? Hi. Yeah. Hi. How can I help? I was calling a project original contractor and I've got a project in San Leandro. I need to replace some siding. Why not replace and install new siding and some windows. I just wanted to see if you guys were interested in the project. You mentioned you're a GC? Yes. Okay. So I don't think it's going to work for us because we're also GCs and you know same thing with you. We're also going to be subbing our stuff up. Okay. So you guys don't do the siding directly? No. We did not. Okay. I mean a lot of times I can't hire a siding guy or window guy directly because they don't carry the insurance. We're pretty big GC. We do a lot of fire restoration and insurance repair. If you're willing to. I mean I've got it for the plans. If you want to take a look at it and let me know what you guys can bid on. I don't have a problem doing it that way. But I do ask that you give me a price for your roofing. Give me a price for framing. Give me a price for windows and doors. Kind of separate it all. Even paint. Whatever you want to bid on. I don't have a problem with it. If you guys are interested. But we may not be able to give you all the project. Or we say hey you're a little high on this number. I've got this other contractor that can do it for this much. Can you match that number and then we give you the whole project. We can work it out that way. But it's just really as long as we're within our budget. We don't have a problem hiring a GC to work under us. Okay just send us the email and then we'll take a look at it. And we'll take it from there. Okay what was your name again? Vivian. Vivian? And what's a what's a good email for you? It's office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Rhino builders? 1989.com. Hello? Yeah I got it. So office at rhinobuilders1989.com. Yeah. Okay. And what all do you guys do? Just so I can put this down in my notes. I'm just trying to keep track. Yeah we do everything. We also build houses from scratch. Okay. I mean this is technically what it is. We're rebuilding it from the ground up. Oh okay. And what city? It has fire. It's on Leandro. Oh it's on Leandro. Okay. So it's not too far from you guys. I pulled you guys up on on Google Maps. And then at least take a look at it and see if you guys would be interested. And then we can go from there. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah I'll keep an eye on that email. Okay. Thank you Vivian. You're welcome. Bye bye. Bye bye.
