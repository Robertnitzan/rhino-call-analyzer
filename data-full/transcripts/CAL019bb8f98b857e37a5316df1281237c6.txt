Hello this is Vivian. Hi Vivian, this is Sarkis. How are you doing today? Sarkis, I'm good. How are you? I'm doing good. How can I help, Sarkis? Happy New Year. Yeah, it's time for 1099s. I know. Oh, I didn't reply to the email. We'll be doing our own 1099, Sarkis. Okay, yeah. Moving forward or do you want me to never follow up on 1099s? Well, you can follow up. I mean, we'll never know if Shai will change his mind, you know. Yeah, yeah. Honestly, that's completely fine by me. I hate 1099s. I'm kidding. I'm always happy to do it, but you know, if you need help, let me know. But for now, I'm just going to take client role. Oh, I wish I could ask for your help, but then not for it. How many do you usually have? It's not much. Um, quite a number. You have everything you put in QuickBooks? Yeah, but everything is in QuickBooks. I can just run it. Yeah, but just make sure that you complete all the information. Oh, yeah, plenty. You have like 34, 35 between events. Yeah, and I think I'm going to still add up to that number. I'm not done yet. Beautiful. Good luck. Let me know if you need help. The deadline is the 31st of this month, so you have two weeks ahead of you. And the W-2 deadline is on February 2nd, correct? Yes, but, you know, better send it out in January, end of January, you know. Yeah, but our W-2 is hooked up with QuickBooks and it says automatic filing on February 2nd. Yeah, that's the last day. So, I don't know because 31st is on Saturday. So, usually they extend it to the next Monday. I see. Okay. As long as, you know, it's connected to QuickBooks, it's automatic. That's fine with me. Make sure they file it. If they don't file it by mistake or any error, you get a civil penalty. But can I file it ahead of time? Yeah, of course. I think QuickBooks allows you to file it ahead of time because you get a civil penalty if you don't file a W-2. They're very strict about that. Alrighty. Okay. We'll do. Thanks so much. Appreciate your help. Sounds good. Okay. Have a good one. You too. Bye-bye.
