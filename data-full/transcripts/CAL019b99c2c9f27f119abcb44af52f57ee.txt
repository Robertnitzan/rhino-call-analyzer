Hello, good morning. Hi, is this Rhino concrete? Yeah. Hi, my name is Lisa and I have a job, a prevailing wage job for a sidewalk replacement in Oakland. Is that something you guys do? Sorry Lisa. Is the sidewalk part of the city? It is, it's an open parking lot that we're working in. We're doing work there in the sidewalk. There's a sidewalk in that parking lot. We already have permits, work approved and everything. Oh, I see. But is that sidewalk part of the property or part of the city? Because if it's part of the city, there's a special kind of contractor who does those type of sidewalks. It's a private parking lot. Oh, okay. So it's within the property. Yes. And what size of the sidewalk? It's about 25 feet. 25 feet. Okay. And so you've got the permits already? We have permits and approval. I see. Okay. So let me check my calendar. Okay. One second. And we can also send plans to you. Oh, you have the plans as well? We do. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Hold on a second, please. Let me just check my calendar one moment. Okay? Okay. Okay. And so we have an opening tomorrow afternoon or Thursday or Friday morning. What would be a good time for you? Friday, probably. Do you want to look at the plans and give us an estimate? Yeah, sure. But we'd love to do a site visit so that we can... Oh, for a site visit. Yeah, yeah. We would love to take a look at the existing conditions before we can give out our estimates. Yeah. Tomorrow would probably work. Okay. Tomorrow afternoon around 3 p.m. I'm sorry, around 1 or 2 p.m. Yeah. That's better. Okay. 1 p.m. Alrighty. So can I please do that? Nope. You cut out. Oh, sorry. Are you the homeowner? It's a commercial property. Oh, commercial. Okay. So we're a business that's subcontracting this out. Oh, you are subcontracting it. Correct. Oh, I see. That's why we have all the permits and everything. But are you a contractor? Yeah. Oh. Well, I'm not sure it's going to work out for us. Because we're also going to be subcontracting it. Oh, are you? Yeah. It's not going to work out for us. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Better look for somebody who does the actual, you know, like sidewalk. Yeah, yeah. We need a contractor that can come and do the sidewalk. Uh-huh. Okay. Well, I wish you luck then. Okay. Thank you. All right. Of course. Thank you so much. Bye. Bye-bye.
